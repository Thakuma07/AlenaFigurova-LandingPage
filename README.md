A sophisticated, highly animated landing page designed for a high-end fashion portfolio. Built with a focus on motion design and minimalist aesthetics, this project showcases a seamless user experience using modern web technologies and the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP).

## ✨ Features

- **Preloader & Counter**: A dynamic loading screen with a percentage counter and word-based progress tracking.
- **GSAP Animations**: Fluid transitions, staggered images, and custom easing for a premium feel.
- **Interactive Gallery**: A reveal animation that scales and positions images with precision.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing with tailored layouts.
- **Typography-First Approach**: Using "DM Mono" and "DM Sans" to create a modern, structured visual identity.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure for accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS3**: Vanilla CSS for custom styling, layouts, and pre-animation states.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Custom logic for DOM manipulation and animation triggering.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**:
  - `gsap.core` for main timelines.
  - `CustomEase` for unique, sophisticated motion curves ("hop" ease).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The project embodies a **minimalist yet impactful** design. By using a dark-to-light transition through the animation timeline, it creates a sense of "reveal" that mirrors the unveiling of a new fashion collection. The overlap of the large background header and the scaled center image provides depth and scale.
